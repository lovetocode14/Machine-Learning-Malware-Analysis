# Objdump + A Linear Classifer!

For my senior project, I used objdump to extract executable code from Windows binaries
and formatted this data and used it to train a machine learning model to predict the 
likelihood a given .exe file is malicious. 

# The Process
1. Used GCC objdump ran from a shell to automate converting over 1000 malicious binaries
   to .txt files
2. Converted hex values of instructions to integer values and padded all to a fixed
   length
3. Wrote a Pocket Algorithm (similar to PLA) that trains a model until it reaches a 
   certain error threshold. Then it returns the weights used. 
4. Used these weights to test on out-of-sample data and make predictions. Over around 
   500 tests it was about 80% accurate.
