# 🔋Objdump + A Linear Classifer!

# 👣The Process
1. Used GCC objdump ran from a shell to automate 
   converting over 1000 malicious binaries
   to .txt files
2. Converted hex values of instructions to integer 
   values and padded all to a fixed
   length
3. Wrote a Pocket Algorithm (similar to PLA) that
   trains a model until it reaches a 
   certain error threshold. Then it returns the
   weights used. 
4. Used these weights to test on out-of-sample
   data and make predictions. Over around 
   500 tests it was about 80% accurate. 
   
# 🐋Docker Build
   My team-member Justin Truong was responsible for deploying the logic to an intuitive web-app, hosted in Flask and built with Docker!
